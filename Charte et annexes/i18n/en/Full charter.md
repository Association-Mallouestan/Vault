## Preface
Creating an alternative is an everyday task. Striving for an ideal is complex. That's why we are compelled to establish a manual for communal living.

> This manual defines the common context to which everyone chooses to adhere by coming to the place or participating in external events organized by Mallouestan.

> This manual is by no means a dogmatic or sectarian support, but rather a reference for a place with an anarchist tendency, and as such, it is intended to evolve.

## Objectives
We are aware that many of the values and goals listed below are difficult to achieve. Therefore, we humbly list them, accepting that each person in the community can only strive for them. The goals are as follows:

- Create resilience/independence from capitalism and consumer society, including but not limited to:
  - Autonomy in fruits and vegetables
  - Autonomy in relation to fossil fuels
  - Autonomy in construction methods and materials
  - Personal accommodation spaces completely disconnected from public networks
- Ensure the sustainability of the sanctuary for non-human animals
- Reduce our ecological impact and our impact on surrounding ecosystems
- Physical and emotional health are essential to autonomous and healthy collective life. Therefore, we seek to develop deep self-awareness to strive for daily personal resilience, aiming to minimize injuries, fatigue, and distress.
- Strive for the abolition, in the context of the place, of the general sense of power of one individual over another. If necessary, make every effort to distribute power horizontally.
- Deconstruct systemic, institutionalized, and oppressive behaviors, including behaviors stemming from patriarchy, racism, ableism, and ageism.
- Minimize prioritizing the interests of one species over another.
- Share our resources and privileges with a focus on solidarity and inclusion.

## Prerequisites
We are aware that each individual is at different levels of deconstruction and evolves at their own pace. However, a minimum level of deconstruction is necessary to ensure progress for the entire group. Like the rest of this charter, none of the mechanisms listed below claim to be sufficient or perfect, but they represent a starting point that seems relevant for the collective's explorations. Therefore, during the stay at the place and events organized by Mallouestan, we ask:

1. No violence, except in cases of legitimate self-defense, towards another individual, which includes but is not limited to the following acts or situations:
   - Verbal or physical aggression
   - Hate speech towards specific individuals
   - Advocacy for violence against other sentient beings
   - Disregard for each individual's freedom to end any social situation they find uncomfortable
   - Any hindrance to an individual's agency (the capacity to act and be autonomous), disregard for individuality (the fact that an individual possesses characteristics that make them unique and distinguishable from others), or disregard for bodily autonomy (the right to make decisions for one's body and future)
2. No consumption, purchase, or promotion of products of animal origin (meat, milk, eggs, honey, leather, wool...) and no promotion of activities related to animal exploitation (horse riding, agility, circus, animal traction, animal collaboration...). Any subject can be discussed, but it should be based on individual opinions rather than universal truth.
3. Respect for the spaces and their signage.
4. Respect for animals, as explained in the "Non-Autonomous Animals" appendix.
5. A minimum level of active communication (initiated by the person possessing the information), as defined in the "Communication at the Place" section.
6. Foods classified as Nova group 4 (https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/nova) are not tolerated in shared common spaces.
7. Foods from the Nova 3 category and with a nutritional score beyond "C" are not allowed in common and shared spaces.
8. Alcohol, nicotine, drugs, and other non-food addictive substances are not allowed in common and shared spaces.
9. Any state of intoxication or influence is not tolerated during occasional events or shared moments of daily life.

> These restrictions do not reflect moral judgments on individuals who may not adhere to them outside of this place. These restrictions are limited to the context we create and have no pretensions beyond that.

> These restrictions should not be used for any purpose towards individuals who do not adhere to them in their personal spaces.

> These restrictions do not apply to products necessary for health (e.g., medication).

## Governance
A balance must be struck between individual freedoms and those of the collective. The following situations, which impact the communal context, must be preceded by a unanimous vote of the individuals affected by the decision:

- Any changes to the charter or its annexes (Budget, Shopping List)
- The assignment of contributor or resident roles, as well as the conditions for a trial period
- Exceptional or one-time expenses defined in the annex for the budget
- Any modifications made by an individual that impact the common spaces and cannot be undone by the same person within a day

Any other decision, unless otherwise specified in the manual, does not require collective agreement. However, communication and transparency are encouraged.

> Any decision can be overturned or opposed by any individual if it contradicts this manual. If there is any ambiguity in the interpretation of the manual, confirmed by 60% of the people present at the location, the ambiguity cannot be attributed to the decision-making process.

> Any exception to the charter can be temporarily implemented (the duration must be specified) with a unanimous vote. The exception is valid as long as only the individuals who participated in implementing the said exception are present at the location.

## Conflict Management
We are aware that we are imperfect beings. Therefore, we all make mistakes or deviate from our values and ideals. We must be understanding, both towards ourselves and others. However, we also accept that any deviation that affects the place and its members can be addressed if someone wishes to do so.

In case of a conflict:
1. We try to resolve it directly between the parties involved.
2. If the conflict cannot be resolved between the parties, a neutral party is involved in conflict management to mediate.
3. If, despite these steps, a member feels oppressed by the conflict, an ultimatum can be defined, granting the perceived oppressor a chance. This ultimatum must be justified by the non-compliance with this manual.

> The ultimatum is given with conditions and consequences related to non-compliance. These criteria and conditions are decided by all members of the collective, excluding the person targeted by potential injunctions. This tool should remain a last resort, and its severity should not be underestimated.

## Ultimatums
Several exceptional ultimatums are de facto defined for all members of the location:
1. Any intentional physical harm, except in self-defense, to an individual at the location may result in exclusion from the location if at least one other member of the location wishes so.
2. Any severe physical harm (death, long-term injuries) caused by a non-resident animal to another individual at the location results in either the exclusion of the animal or, if the animal's caretaker(s) wish(es), an ultimatum directly involving them.

## Collective Life
### Communication on Site
One-time or daily events that are intended to be collective (meals, meetings, etc.) require clear and functional communication through ubiquitous means of communication (shared by everyone). The objective of this communication is to enable everyone to participate or be informed so that each person is included in collective life.

> Example: For meals, notify all individuals at the location.

Communication is inherently complex and personal. It is important to accommodate these differences as best as possible (oral, written, etc.). Nevertheless, minimum active communication (initiated by the person holding the information) is necessary regarding the common context and daily collective life at the location. We therefore request clear communication on the following points:
- Regarding responsibilities of the bookmarks
- Regarding daily and weekly tasks
- Regarding the presence or absence of people staying at the location
- Regarding any health condition that poses a risk or danger

### Space Occupancy
The following spaces at the location can be reserved for exclusive use:
- The "salle a'tout"
- The Mobile Home
- The office
- The multipurpose space

Reservation schedules are validated and thus become effective at each meeting.

If a space is not reserved, exclusivity is granted, if desired, to the first arrivals.

### Financial Management
Certain expenses depend on communal life. A common fund is therefore made available for everyone to contribute according to their means.

Various donations are added to the common fund. During meetings, the money in the common fund is allocated to expenses related to animals, expenses for the eco-place, as well as expenses for the upcoming week's shopping.

> A budget is collectively defined at the location to cover all necessary and communal expenses.

> A common shopping list is defined, specifying the products to be purchased with the associated budget.

The following funds are available at the location and are regulated by the "Funds and Mutuals" appendix:
1. Solidarity Fund
2. Subsistence Mutual Aid
3. Sanctuary Relief Fund
4. Agrarian Liberation Fund
5. Fund for Wildlife and Flora

### Investment
Every resident at the location acknowledges that expenses related to the place are not guaranteed to be refunded. The land and real estate are the responsibility of the individual, and thus, other residents cannot guarantee the purchase or sale of the property.

> Each resident is encouraged, in the event of a member's departure, to assist the departing person according to their means.

### Mental Load, Bookmark, and Pole
The mental load of all tasks necessary to operate the location is considerable. It cannot rely on a single person or a minority within the collective. In addition to the load, it is not desirable to centralize responsibilities. This load is therefore distributed among volunteers who have the mental load and responsibility for a subset of tasks and mechanisms, called a "pole." These individuals, known as "bookmarks," are responsible for the functioning of a pole, but it does not exclude the participation of anyone present at the location. In fact, it is encouraged to avoid specialization or monopolization and to promote a rich collective life.

Decisions are made collectively during planning for each pole, where a budget and objectives are defined for the following quarter.

### Space Provision
In the context of hosting and accommodation, outside of the dormitories, we provide spaces that, if not shared with other groups, become de facto personal spaces.

## External Communication
Any communication on behalf of Mallouestan must be in accordance with this charter and must only express political, activist, or philosophical positions present in this charter (anarchism, antispeciesism, etc.). Any personal statement by the communicator that is not present in this charter must not be expressed on behalf of Mallouestan.

## Roles and Responsibilities
With the aim of minimizing power at the location, the following roles are defined to help each individual better understand their responsibilities and duties.

### Every Person
Has the right to:
- Oversight over the operation of the association.

### Visitor
Any person present at the location who commits to respecting this handbook.

Visitors have several responsibilities:
- A visitor is responsible for their actions and behavior at the location. They are in charge of their daily life and responsible for communication with the entire collective.
- In the case of a visit lasting more than 24 hours, a visitor is responsible for maintenance tasks (cleaning, changing a light bulb, etc.) of the premises and any equipment they use at the location, within their capabilities. Otherwise, they must notify the entire collective.
- To do everything possible to ensure that the charter is respected by everyone. To avoid a context of denunciation, only interpersonal situations where the well-being of another person at the location is at stake require intervention or notification of the entire collective.

Visitors have the following rights:
- To participate in all collective events of daily and weekly life.
- To use the money from the common fund for weekly expenses at the location (gas bottle, maintenance).
- The right to veto and make decisions regarding the common context during their stay. However, this decision-making power is limited to two months, even in the case of a longer stay.
- The right to equal opportunities at the location (not guaranteed outcomes) regarding participation in events, daily activities, and any other collective dynamics at the location.

### Contributor
Any person wishing to contribute to the project or a specific aspect of the project can become a contributor if they wish to do so, and by doing so, they accept the following responsibilities:
- The responsibility to ensure compliance with the charter and to intervene or resolve potential issues.
- The responsibility to actively contribute to the progress of the project as a whole towards the aforementioned objectives.
- To be considered involved in changes to the common context (and thus hold decision-making power), even when absent from the location. In the event of being unreachable, the contributor has two weeks to share their decision.
- To approve or reject exceptions to the charter, even when absent from the location. In the event of being unreachable, the contributor has two weeks to share their decision. The following point is not included:
	- The quota for visitors.

Contributors have the same rights as visitors, as well as the following:
- The right to veto and make decisions regarding the common context, with no time limit.
- The right to make decisions about the money reserved for exceptional expenses.

### Resident
Residents are contributors as well as visitors, so they have the rights and duties of each role, as well as the following rights:
- The right to enjoy a personal space reserved without a time limit.

They are obligated to fulfill the following duties:
- To ensure on a daily basis that the needs of non-human animals are met.
- The responsibility to provide visitors with the necessary resources for the duration of their stay.

## Limits and Quotas
In view of the size and resources available, certain limits and quotas have been defined:
- A maximum of 5 personal spaces is set at the location, allowing 5 couples/families to live at the location at present.
- A maximum of 16 visitors at a time is set for overnight stays at the location.
