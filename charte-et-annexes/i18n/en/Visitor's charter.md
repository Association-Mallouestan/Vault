## Visitor's Guide to Mallouestan

## Preface
Creating an alternative is an everyday task. Striving for an ideal is complex. That is why we are compelled to establish a manual for communal living.

> This manual defines the common context that everyone chooses to adhere to when coming to this place or participating in external events organized by Mallouestan.

> This manual is by no means a dogmatic or sectarian support, but rather a reference for a place with an anarchist tendency, thus it is subject to evolution.

## Objectives
We are aware that many of the values and objectives listed below are difficult to achieve. Therefore, we humbly list them, acknowledging that each individual in this place can only strive towards them.
- Establish a common resilience/independence in relation to capitalism and consumer society, including but not limited to:
  - Autonomy in fruits and vegetables
  - Autonomy in terms of fossil fuels
  - Autonomy in construction methods and materials
  - Personal living spaces completely disconnected from public networks
- Ensure the longevity of the sanctuary for non-human animals
- Reduce our ecological impact and our impact on surrounding ecosystems
- Physical and emotional well-being are essential to our collective autonomous and healthy life. Therefore, we seek to develop a deep self-awareness to strive for daily personal resilience. The goal is to minimize injuries, fatigue, and distress.
- Strive, in this place, for the abolition of any form of power of one individual over another. In case it exists, make every effort to distribute power horizontally.
- Deconstruct systemic, institutionalized, and oppressive behaviors, particularly those stemming from patriarchy, racism, ableism, and ageism.
- Minimize prioritizing the interests of one species over another.
- Share our resources and privileges with solidarity and inclusivity in mind.

## Prerequisites
We understand that each individual is at different levels of deconstruction and evolves at their own pace. Despite this, a minimum level of deconstruction is necessary to ensure progress for the entire group. Like the rest of this charter, the mechanisms below do not claim to be sufficient or perfect but represent a starting point that seems relevant for collective explorations. Therefore, during your stay at Mallouestan and when participating in events organized by Mallouestan, we kindly ask you to:

1. Refrain from any violence, except in cases of legitimate self-defense, towards another individual. This includes, but is not limited to, the following types of violence or situations:
   - Verbal or physical aggression
   - Speech inciting hatred towards specific individuals
   - Speech advocating violence against other sentient beings
   - Disregard for each individual's freedom to exit any social situation they find uncomfortable
   - Any hindrance to an individual's agency (the capacity to act autonomously), disrespect for individuality (the fact that an individual possesses characteristics that distinguish them from others), or disregard for bodily autonomy (the right to make decisions about one's own body and future)
2. Avoid consuming, purchasing, or promoting products of animal origin (meat, milk, eggs, honey, leather, wool, etc.) and refrain from promoting activities related to animal exploitation (e.g., horseback riding, agility, circus, animal-drawn transportation, animal collaboration). While these topics can be discussed, they should be regarded as individual opinions rather than universal truths.
3. Respect the spaces and their respective signage.
4. Treat animals as explained in Annex [[A3 Non-Autonomous Animals.4.0.pdf]].
5. Engage in a minimum level of active communication (initiated by the person holding the information) as defined in the "Communication on the Premises" section.
6. Foods classified as Nova 4 (https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/nova) are not allowed in common and shared spaces.
7. Foods classified as Nova 3 and with a nutritional score beyond "C" are not allowed in common and shared spaces.
8. Alcohol, nicotine, drugs, and other non-food addictive substances are not allowed in common and shared spaces.
9. Intoxication or being under the influence is not tolerated during events or shared moments of daily life.

> These restrictions do not reflect moral judgments on individuals who may not adhere to them outside of this place. These restrictions are limited to the context we create and have no pretensions beyond that.

> These restrictions should not be used for any purposes regarding individuals who do not adhere to them in their personal spaces.

> These restrictions do not apply to necessary health-related products (e.g., medication).

## Governance
A balance must be found between individual freedoms and collective ones. The following situations, which impact the communal context, require a unanimous vote from the individuals affected by the decision:

- Any change to the charter or its annexes (Budget, Shopping List)
- Assigning contributor or resident roles, as well as the conditions for a trial period
- Exceptional or one-time expenses defined in the annex for the budget
- Any modification by an individual that impacts common spaces and cannot be undone by the same person within a day

Any other decision, unless otherwise specified in the manual, does not require collective agreement; however, communication and transparency are encouraged.

> Any decision can be overturned or opposed by any person if it contradicts the present manual. If there is doubt regarding the interpretation of the manual, confirmed by 60% of the people present on the premises, the ambiguity cannot be attributed to the decision-making process.

> Any exception to the charter can be temporarily implemented (duration must be specified) through a unanimous vote. The exception remains valid as long as only the individuals who participated in establishing the said exception are present on the premises.

## Conflict Management
We are aware that we are imperfect beings. Therefore, we all make mistakes or deviate from our values and ideals. We must be understanding towards ourselves and others. However, we also accept that any deviation that impacts the place and its members can be addressed if someone wishes to do so.

In the event of a conflict:
1. We try to resolve it directly between the involved parties.
2. If the conflict cannot be resolved between the parties, a neutral party is brought in to mediate the conflict.
3. If, despite these steps, a member feels oppressed by the conflict, an ultimatum can be defined, giving the perceived oppressor a chance to rectify the situation. This ultimatum must be justified by a violation of this manual.

> The ultimatum is given with conditions and the consequences related to non-compliance. These criteria and conditions are decided by all members of the collective, excluding the person targeted by potential injunctions. This tool should remain a last resort, and its severity should not be underestimated.

## Ultimatums
Several exceptional ultimatums are de facto defined for all members of the place:
1. Any intentional physical harm, excluding self-defense, to an individual of the place may result in their exclusion if at least one other member of the place wishes so.
2. Any severe physical harm (death, long-term injuries) caused by a non-resident animal to another individual of the place results in either the exclusion of the animal or, if the responsible party or parties of the animal wish, an ultimatum directly concerning them.
